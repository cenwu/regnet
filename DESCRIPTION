Description: This package provides procedures for fitting network-based regularization,
	minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty for generalized linear models. This first
	version, regent0.1.0, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for continuous, survival outcomes 
	and other regularization methods will be included in the forthcoming upgraded version.
