Description: This package provide procedures for fitting network-based regularization,
	minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty for generalized linear model. This first
	version regent1.0 focus on binary outcome. Functions for continuous, survival outcome 
	and other regularization methods will be included in the coming upgraded version.
